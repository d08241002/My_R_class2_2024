-----------------------

Previously we used `str` to learn the **structure** of an object. Knowing the type and structure of the data you are working on is crucial for any further analysis. Nevertheless, this step is often skipped, which can lead to serious problems in the following steps. This section introduces some common data types and  structures  that are frequently encountered in this course.

# Core data types

These data types, or **modes**, determine how the values are stored in the computer. You can determine the mode of an object with the `typeof` function. Note that R also has a built-in `mode` function that serves the same purpose, with the only exception that it does not distinguish between **integers** and **doubles** (see meanings below).

## Numeric

The **numeric** data type is probably the simplest. It consists of numbers such as **integers** (iwhole-valued positive or negative number or 0, e.g. 1 ,-3 ,33 ,0) or **doubles** (e.g. 0.3, 12.4, -0.04, 1.0). For example, to create a numeric (double) vector, we can write:

```{r,  eval=T}
x <- c(1.0, -3.4, 2, 140.1) # numeric and double
typeof(x) 
mode(x)
```

Note that removing the fractional part of a number when creating a numeric object does not necessarily create an integer. For example, creating an apparent integer object results in a double with `typeof` :

```{r,  eval=T}
x <- 4
typeof(x)
```

To force R to recognize a value as an integer, add a capital `L` to the number.

```{r,  eval=T}
x <- 4L
typeof(x)
```

## Character

The data type **character** consists of letters or words such as "a", "f", "project", "birds".

```{r,  eval=T}
x <- c("bubul", "magpie", "spoonbill", "barbet")
typeof(x)
```

Characters can also consist of numbers that are represented as characters. The distinction between a character representation of a number and a numerical representation is important. For example, if we have two numeric vectors `x` and `y` such as:


```{r,  eval=T}
x <- 3
y <- 5.3
x + y
```

If we repeat these steps, but instead of representing `x` and `y` as **numeric** and **doubles** we enter '3' and '5.3' as **characters**. When we try to add them up, we will logically get an error:


```{r,  eval=T}
x <- "3"
y <- "5.3"

# not run:  x+ y

###########################################################
# Error in x + y: non-numeric argument to binary operator #
###########################################################

```

Note the use of quotation marks to force **double** to be recognized as **character**. Be careful that some functions like `plot` automatically convert **character** to **double**. Try `plot(x,y)`, it works!

## Logical

Logical values can take one of two values/conditions: `TRUE` or `FALSE`. These can also be represented as `1` or `0`, which are later assigned as **logical** values. For example, to create a logical vector with 4 elements, you can enter the following:

```{r,  eval=T}
# full text:
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
# or in short:
x <- c(T, F, F, T)
```

or

```{r,  eval=T}
x1<-c(1,0,0,1)
x2 <- as.logical(c(1,0,0,1))
# OR: x3 <- as.logical(c(1,0,0,1))
```

Note that `typeof` returns **logical** in both cases. Also note that the `1` and `0` in the last example are converted internally into `TRUE` and `FALSE` using the function `as.logical` (= create a logical vector).

# Derived data types

These data types are stored either as numeric, character or logical, but have additional *attribute* information that allows these objects to be handled in a special way by certain functions. These attributes define the **class** of an object and can be extracted from an object using the `class` function.

## Factor

**Factor** is used to group variables into a fixed number of unique categories or **levels**. For example, a data set can be grouped by *gender* or *month* of year. Such data is usually loaded into R as a **numeric** or **character** data type and must then be converted into a factor using the `as.factor` function (if this has not been done automatically when importing the data).

```{r,  eval=T}
a <- c("M", "F", "F", "U", "F", "M", "M", "M", "F", "U")
typeof(a) # mode character
class(a)# class character
a.fact <- as.factor(a)
class(a.fact)# class factor
```

**Note**: `a` has not changed the mode. The data is still of the type `character`. However, it may seem strange at first, but the derived object `a.fact` is now stored as an `integer`!

```{r,  eval=T}
mode(a.fact)
typeof(a.fact)
```

However, when we display the content of `a.fact` we see character values.

```{r,  eval=T}
a.fact
```

**為什麼** (why)?Well, `a.fact` is a more complicated object than the simple objects created so far. In fact, **factor** stores additional information not visible in its output. This hidden information is stored in **attributes**. To see these hidden attributes, use the `attributes` function.

```{r,  eval=T}
attributes(a.fact)
```

There are two attributes: `levels` and `class`. The `levels` attribute lists the three unique values in `a.fact`. The order in which these levels are listed reflects their *numeric* representation [see `str (a.fact)` and the numeric sequence generated: `2 1 1 3 ...`]. So essentially, `a.fact` stores each value as an integer that refers to one of the three unique levels. The unique levels of a factor and the order in which they are stored can be extracted using the `levels` function.

```{r,  eval=T}
levels(a.fact)
```

Remember that the order in which the levels are displayed corresponds to their integer representation. If they are to be  displayed in a different order (e.g. first U, then F, then M), we must change it by recreating the factor object as follows:

```{r,  eval=T}
factor(a, levels=c("U","F","M"))
```

This detail is crucial when you are trying to rearrange elements in a plot, so you need to remember it.

<p class="comment">
**Practice 3.1** Understanding the factors and their levels is crucial, especially if you are creating subgroups or plots. Let's find out together why this is so by using the `iris` dataset. Subset species `setosa` and `virginica` into a new dataset that you call `iris.sel`. Check the `levels` in the variable `iris.sel$Species`. Conclude on the possible consequences?
</p>

```{r, class.source = "fold-hide",  eval=F}
iris.sel<- subset(iris, Species == "setosa" | Species == "virginica")
levels(iris.sel$Species)  # 3 species are still there
```


> To delete a level after a subset, you can use the `droplevels` function for a specific variable. Try it with the variable `iris.sel$Species` and compare the results with the help of boxplots (`?boxplot`).


It is now time to change the row names in our subset:

```{r,  eval=F}
rownames(iris.sel) = seq(length=nrow(iris.sel))
```

## Date

Date values are stored as numbers. But to be properly interpreted as a date object in R, their attribute must be explicitly defined as **date**. `base` offers many ways to convert and manipulate dates and times, but a package called `lubridate` [see `library (lubridate)`] makes working with dates/times much easier. Working with dates could be the subject of a separate topic, and it will no be covered here.

## NAs and NULLs

You often find missing or unknown values in data sets that you may be tempted to assign **0**. However, this can be very wrong and lead to many undesirable results when analyzing the data. R has two placeholders for such elements: `NA` and `NULL`.

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
x <- c(23, NA, 1.2, 5)
```

`NA` (Not Available) is an indicator for a missing value. It indicates that a value should be available but is unknown.


```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
y <- c(23, NULL, 1.2, 5)
```

The `NULL` object also stands for missing values, but its interpretation is slightly different, as it implies that the value does not exist or that it’s not measurable.

The difference between `NA` and `NULL` may seem subtle, but their interpretation in some functions can lead to different outcomes. For example, when computing the mean of `x`, R returns an `NA` value:

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
mean(x)
```

This serves as a control to remind the user that one of the elements is missing. This can be circumvented by setting the `na.rm` parameter to `TRUE` as in `mean(x, na.rm=T)` in which case R ignores the missing value.

A `NULL` object, on the other hand, is treated differently. Since `NULL` implies that a value should not exist, R no longer sees the need to treat such an element as questionable and allows the mean value to be calculated:

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
mean(y)
```

It happens more often that data tables with missing elements are filled with `NA` than with `NULL`. So if you have no particular reason to use `NULL` as a missing value, use `NA` instead.

# Data structures

Most of the data sets we work with consist of batches of values such as a **table** (e.g. temperature values) or a list of results (e.g. annual survey). These batches of data are stored in R in one of several data structures. These include **(atomic) vectors**, **data frames**, **matrices** and **lists**.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Some common data structures", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("illustrations/data_structures.png")
```



## (Atomic) vectors

The **atomic vector** (or **vector** for short) is the simplest data structure in R, consisting of an ordered set of values of the same type and/or class (e.g. numeric, character, date, etc…). As before, a vector can simply be created with the combination function `c()` as in :

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
x <- c(674 , 4186 , 5308 , 5083 , 6140 , 6381)
x
```

As we have already seen, a vector object is an **indexable** collection of values that provides access to a particular index number (subscript). Remimber, to access the third element of `x`, type:


```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
x[3]
```

Also seen before, but you can select a subset of elements by index values using the `c()`:

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
x[c(1,3,4)]
```

If you are interested in a range of indexed values, such as index 2 to 4, use the operator `:`:

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
x[2:4]
```

You can also assign new values to a specific index. For example, we can replace the second value in the vector `x` with `0`:

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
x[2] <- 0
x
```

Note that a vector can store any type of data, such as characters.

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
x <- c("all", "b", "olive")
x
```

However, **a vector can only be of one type**. For example, you cannot mix numeric and character types as follows:

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
x <- c( 1.2, 5, "Rt", "2000")
```

In such a situation, R converts the element types to the **highest common mode**, in the order **NULL** < **logical** < **integer** < **double** < **character**. In our working example, the elements are converted to characters:

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
typeof(x)
```

## Matrices and arrays

Matrices in R can be thought of as vectors that are indexed with two indices instead of one. For example, the following line of code generates a 3 x 3 matrix with randomly generated values. The parameters `nrow` and `ncol` define the dimension of the matrix and the function `runif` generates nine random numbers between 0 and 10 that fill this matrix.

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
m <- matrix(runif(9,0,10), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
m
```


If a vector of higher dimensions is desired, use the `array` function to create the n-dimensional object. A 3x3x3 array can be created as follows:

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
m <- array(runif(27,0,10), c(3,3,3))
m
```

Matrices and arrays can store numeric or character data types, but not both. They are derived directly from the vector structure, but have a higher number of dimensions.

## Data frames

A **data frame** is the closest thing we have to a table. It is an extension of the matrix object, because unlike a matrix, a data frame can *mix* the data types across columns (e.g. both **numeric** and **character** columns can coexist in a data frame), but the data type remains the same across rows.


```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
name   <- c("a1", "a2", "b3")
value1 <- c(23, 4, 12)
value2 <- c(1, 45, 5)
dat    <- data.frame(name, value1, value2)
dat
str(dat) # provide structure
attributes(dat) # provide attributes
names(dat) # extract colum names
rownames(dat) # extract row names
```

## Lists

A **list** is an ordered set of components stored in a 1D vector. Strictly speaking, it is a different kind of vector, a **recursive vector**, where each vector element can have a different data type and structure. This means that **each element of a list** can contain complex objects such as **matrix**, **data frame** and even in some cases other **list** objects embedded in the **list**! Think of a list as a single-column spreadsheet where each cell contains a single number, a three-paragraph record, or even a five-column table.

A list is created with the `list` function. For example, the following list consists of three components: a two-column data frame (referred to as component `A`), a logical vector with two elements (referred to as component `B`) and a character vector with three elements (referred to as component `C`).


```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
A <- data.frame(
     x = c(7.3, 29.4, 29.4, 2.9, 12.3, 7.5, 36.0, 4.8, 18.8, 4.2),
     y = c(5.2, 26.6, 31.2, 2.2, 13.8, 7.8, 35.2, 8.6, 20.3, 1.1) )
B <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
C <- c("apples", "oranges", "round")
my.list <- list(A = A, B = B, C = C)
```

You can view each component’s structure using the `str` function.


```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
str(my.list)
names(my.list)
```

Each component of a list can be extracted using the `$` symbol followed by that component’s name. For example, to access component A from list `my.list`, type:


```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
my.list$A
```

You can also access the same component via its numerical index. Since A is the first component in `lst`, its numerical index is `1`.

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
my.list[[1]]
class(my.list[[1]])
```

Note that components do not need names. For example, we could have created a list like this (note the omission of `A=`, `B=`, etc…):


```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
my.list.notags <- list(A, B, D)
my.list.notags
```

When lists do not have component names, the `names` function will return NULL.

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
names(my.list.notags)
```


You will notice that many functions in R return list objects as output. For example, if we fit a linear model between the elements `x` and `y` (in the data frame `A`), the output of this model (here M) is a list:


```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
M <- lm( y ~ x, A)
str(M)
names(M)
```

The list `M` is more complex than the simple list `my.list` that was created before. Not only does it have more components, but it also stores a greater* range of data types and structures. For example, the element `qr` is itself a list with five elements!

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
str(M$qr)
```

So if we want to access the element rank in the component `qr` of the list `M`, we can use:

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
M$qr$rank
```

This structure of the output of a function is common. It is specified with `lm` in the help of the function (`?lm`): *"object of class "lm" is a **list** containing at least the following components"*

# Coercing data

Data can be converted from one type to another. For example, to convert the following vector object from character to numeric, use the function `as.numeric`.

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
y   <- c("23.8", "6", "100.01","6")
y.c <- as.numeric(y)
y.c
```

The function `as.numeric` converts the vector into a double (you could also have used the function `as.double`). If you convert `y` to an integer, R will remove all decimals from the number.

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
as.integer(y)
```

To convert a number to a character use `as.character`

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
numchar <- as.character(y.c)
numchar
```

You can also coerce a number or a character into a factor.

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
numfac <- as.factor(y)
numfac
```

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
charfac <- as.factor(y.c)
charfac
```


There are many other coercion functions in R, a summary of some of the most common ones we will use in this course, and others:


```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=F}
as.numeric  # Coerce to numeric
as.double	# Coerce to double
as.integer	# Coerce to integer
as.character #	Coerce to character
as.logical	# Coerce to Boolean (logical: TRUE | FALSE)
as.factor	# Coerce to factor
as.Date  # Coerce to date
as.data.frame  # Coerce to data frame
as.list # Coerce to list
```

<p class="alert">
**`r knitr::asis_output("\U26A0")` Practice 3.2** Create the following data frame from scratch. In this short and not very scientific experiment, the growth conditions of five plant individuals are to be tested. The height of the plants will be measured at the beginning of the experiment and after one week. The `height` is a double; the time of the measurement (`start_experiment` and `end_experiment`) and the individual plants (`plant 1`, `plant 2`,`plant 3`,`plant 4` and `plant 5`) are **character** vectors. Reformat this data frame to obtain the `height` into one single column and the `time` of the measurement as a factor with two levels. You save this **data frame** as the first element of a list named **`my.experiment`**. The second element of this list will be another list called **`growth`**, in which three elements are stored: [1] a **character vector** extracting the row names of the previously created table ; [2] a **numeric vector** (double) indicating the change in height of each plant (can be positive or negative, but will be calculated as a percentage of the initial height); [3] a combination of these two elements in a **table with two columns**: `plants` and `growth`. The third element of the **`my.experiment`** list will be an arbitrary message about the growth status of these plants. You will put both your *.Rmd* and *.html* files in a public repository accessible through your Github account. You will email me [vianneydenis@g.ntu.edu.tw] with the address (URL) of this repository (e.g. https://github.com/vianneydenis/OCEAN5098B.git) **before next Monday** so that I can review your work.
